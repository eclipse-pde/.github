# Eclipse PDE™

The Eclipse PDE™ (Plug-in Development Environment) provides tools to create, develop, test, debug, build and deploy Eclipse plug-ins, fragments, features, update sites and RCP products.

PDE also provides comprehensive OSGi tooling, which makes it an ideal environment for component programming, not just Eclipse plug-in development.

PDE is built atop the Platform and JDT, and ships as part of the Eclipse SDK.

In PDE we do tooling, but our business is people!


## PDE Components

The PDE subproject is broken down into three main components,UI, API Tools and Build. There are two additional components in PDE, Doc which handles the help documentation and Incubator which develops non-SDK features.

### PDE UI 

Models, builders, editors and more to faciliate plug-in development in the Eclipse IDE.

### PDE API 

Tools Eclipse IDE and build process integrated tooling to maintain API

### PDE Build 

Ant based tools and scripts to automate build processesPDE IncubatorDevelopment of new tools that are not ready to be added to the Eclipse SDK

### PDE Doc 

Help documentation for PDE, shared by the other components.

## Reporting issues

The Eclipse PDE project is split into multiple Git repositories, which are all part of this organization. If you face an issue and have a sense of which particular GitHub repository is most related, you can open your issue against that repository. If you're unsure, you can open an issue against this current repositories and the issue will then be moved as best by maintainers.

## Contributing

[Contributions are always welcome!](https://github.com/eclipse-pde/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Please bear in mind that this project is almost entirely developed by volunteers. If you do not provide the implementation yourself (or pay someone to do it for you), the bug might never get fixed. If it is a serious bug, other people than you might care enough to provide a fix.
