# Eclipse PDE™

The Eclipse PDE™ (Plug-in Development Environment) provides tools to create, develop, test, debug, build, and deploy Eclipse plug-ins, fragments, features, update sites, and RCP products.

PDE also provides comprehensive OSGi tooling, which makes it an ideal environment for component development, not just Eclipse plug-in development.

PDE is built on the [Platform](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/) and [JDT](https://github.com/eclipse-jdt/), and ships as part of the Eclipse SDK.

In PDE we do tooling, but our business is the community!


## PDE's Components

The PDE project is broken down into 4 main components, Core, API Tools, Build, and Doc.

### PDE (Core)

Models, builders, editors, views, and so on to faciliate plug-in development in the [Eclipse IDE](https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/).

### PDE API 

Integrated tools for the Eclipse IDE and for use in build processes to maintain proper APIs.

### PDE Build 

Ant-based tools and scripts to automate build processes.

### PDE Doc 

Help documentation for PDE which is [stored on its own](https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/tree/master/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user) in the PDE sources.

## Contributing

[Contributions are always welcome!](https://github.com/eclipse-pde/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Please bear in mind that this project is almost entirely developed by volunteers. If you do not provide the implementation yourself, or sponsor someone to do it for you, the bug might never get fixed.  If it is a serious bug, other people might care enough to provide a fix.
